Sharing my configuration files of my Arch installation on which I also use Hyprland.
My config stays minimal, not even having a status bar nor extremely fancy features.

There is really no tutorial needed on how to set your Hyprland as mine, just put bash scripts in /usr/local/bin/ and other config files in their place.
And there is no need for downloading/setting up sync.sh since I use it only to copy my config files to other directory for this Github repo. In one sentence: don't bother with it.

Bash scripts -> /usr/local/bin/

Dotfiles     -> ~/.config/

.bashrc      -> ~/

Also, have a good day! :)
